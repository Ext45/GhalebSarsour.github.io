       <h2>Flappy Bird AI: </h2>
        <br> 
        <div class="P1-Website">
            <p>This project was done with my groupmates to learn more about how machine learning works. Machine learning is giving computers the ability to learn/adapt without human interference. When deciding on our project, my groupmates and I decided to try and use machine learning to teach a computer how to play flappy bird all on its own. We chose flappy bird specifically as it is very popular, it is a simple game that wouldn't be too difficult for the program to learn, and there were a large amount of resources online that could help us if we got stuck. Using python, we created a machine learning algorithm using the NEAT framework and made it play flappy bird. This project taught me the inner workings of machine learning and how factors such as neurons, weight, fitness, and other variables are critical in training a machine learning model. I also learned about the practical uses of machine learning as well. The ability for a program to be able to learn and adapt could be useful for programs that are designed to be used in unpredictable enviornments, such as rovers on the moon or probes in the deep ocean. Machine learning gives us the ability to build intelligent programs that can adapt to solve problems without having to be manually coded.</p>

            <p>This is my first Rust project that I made to learn some of the basics of rust. It is a terminal command that can be used to find a 
               specific file fast by simply typing out " fnall 'file' ". For a more focused search, you can optionally specify a directory like: " fnall 'file' 'directory' "</p>

        <div class="P1-Website">
            <p>This project is the website you are currently visiting. Instead of using a website maker online such as Weebly and Google Sites, I wanted to make my own website
            using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. This is the first websites that I have built that will be a full website and not for learning. Due to this and only having
            four days to complete this project, the source code is not very organized and well documented, which is what I am planning to fix in the future (Source code can be found in my GitHub).</p>
